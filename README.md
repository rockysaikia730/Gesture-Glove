# Gesture-Glove

The purpose of this project is to aid the Speech impaired people. The gestures are predetermined based on general movement that we take while expressing our thoughts. So it makes use of bluetooth technology to convert the gestures into audio so that the speech impaired people can communicate freely with the people who are not well versed in sign language.
